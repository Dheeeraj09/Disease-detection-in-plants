# Disease-detection-in-plants

Build a convolutional model from scratch by using different combination of convolutional layers, max pooling layers and dropout layers. Once trained, this model would accept a plant image as an input and would return “SpecieName_DiseaseName” if disease is detected otherwise it would return “SpecieName_Healthy”.
Over all accuracy is 94%.
